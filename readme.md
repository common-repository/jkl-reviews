A simple Reviews plugin to review books, music, movies, products, or online courses with Star Ratings and links out to related sites.

##Description

As an avid reader myself, I wanted a better way to save the best of the best of what I read on my blog. I wanted a way to quickly and easily save book information, my 5-star rating, and external links out to the book and its resources to save for my own future and personal reference.

The primary functionality of this plugin is to store book (or product) information in a Custom Meta Box beneath your Post editor (in the back-end) that will then be displayed in its own "ratings ID card" at the top of your Post (in the front-end). 

Best of all: This plugin allows you to quickly input all the relevant information and links related to your review and have those *consistently* display in the same (responsive) format in your Posts without you ever needing to worry about styling 
or formatting the review boxes yourself. This allows you to spend more time writing the review itself and less time worrying about the display of your review.

In short: This plugin makes writing reviews fun and simple as the styling is all 
taken care of for you.

Requires WordPress 3.5 and PHP 5.
